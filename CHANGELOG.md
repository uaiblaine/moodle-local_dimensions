# Changelog

All notable changes to the **local_dimensions** plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

Macro view of everything since v1.0 — per-change detail lives in the commit history.

### Added
- **Competency hub** (`central.php`): a single admin surface for the whole competency domain —
  three dynamic tabs with modal-based CRUD, a system/category context switch and no full-page
  reloads.
  - *Structures*: lazy competency tree with search-and-reveal, drag-and-drop reorder/reparent,
    move-to-position modal, native rule editor, display toggles and per-competency usage
    counters (courses / activities / plans).
  - *Learning plans*: master-detail template management — search and multi-competency filter,
    create/edit/delete in modals, **full duplication** (custom fields, embedded files and card
    images included), competency picker + framework browser, drag-and-drop ordering, resizable
    panes.
  - *Frameworks*: native create/edit with scale configuration, duplicate, visibility toggle,
    reason-gated delete and **CSV import/export**.
  - Modals: *Participants* (cohorts with background plan sync, individual users, cohort-role
    assignment), *Courses & activities* (linking with rule outcomes, activity search,
    completion-rule badges), *Related competencies* (shared tree browser).
  - ~30 AJAX web services back the hub; the front-end is ESM, zero-YUI, Bootstrap 4+5
    compatible.
- **Per-user persistent hub state**: last tab/context/framework/template, display toggles and
  gear panels survive sessions and devices (two JSON user preferences + privacy provider).
- **13 administrative audit events** for decisions core never logs: cohort attach/detach,
  cohort-role rules, custom-field value changes (effective-value diff, SCSS redacted),
  course/activity links with rule outcomes, and template duplication.
- **Concurrency safeguards**: custom-field provisioning under a core Lock API lock,
  deduplicated cohort-sync task queueing, and a retry on concurrent first-saves of custom
  fields.
- **Learner views**: taxonomy card, Rules-tab filters and warnings with backend-provided
  texts, status/taxonomy icon assets, plan-trail session cache, and a draggable Return-to-Plan
  button.
- **CI**: moodle-an-hochschulen reusable workflow — static checks plus PHPUnit and Behat
  across the supported PHP × DB matrix (Moodle 4.05–5.02).

### Changed
- The **Return-to-Plan button** was hardened end to end: redirect loops are structurally
  impossible, it renders only on course-content layouts (never in secure quiz windows or on
  administrative pages), only for the plan's own user, and stale contexts expire (4h TTL).
- Editing UX unified around core `dynamic_form` modals with in-modal toasts and row flashes;
  pagination standardised at 25 across grids and pickers.

### Removed
- The entire **legacy admin surface**: `manage_competencies.php`, `manage_templates.php`, the
  `edit_*` pages, their forms, templates and AMD modules, ~2.3k lines of CSS and 125 orphaned
  language strings — the hub covers every action they offered.
- The **comments** feature (accordion reply threads, its services, JS, CSS and strings).
- Client-side SCSS validation (the server-side validator is the single gate) and the unused
  customfield-aware CRUD web services.

### Fixed
- Custom-field data leaked on competency/template deletion (Moodle 5.1+ context teardown).
- Bootstrap 4 dropdowns dead on Moodle 4.5 (missing `data-toggle` bridges).
- Web-service return structures silently stripping undeclared fields from lazily-fetched rows.
- TinyMCE not initialising on template edit; assorted modal heading/labelling issues.

## [1.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Two display modes for learning plans: **Competency tracker** (course card grid) and **Full plan overview** (expandable accordion).
- Custom fields for competencies and learning plan templates: card image, background image, background colour, text colour, tags, display mode, and custom SCSS.
- Auto-provisioning of custom fields on first admin access when core competencies are enabled.
- Real-time course section progress calculation with recursive subsection support (Flexsections, `mod_subsection`).
- Competency completion rules display (Rules tab) in Full plan overview, showing rule type, rule outcome, sub-competency progress, proficiency status, and required flags.
- Evidence cards with detail modals in accordion panels.
- Related competencies display (optionally clickable) in accordion panels.
- Competency hierarchy path display (framework → parent → competency).
- Floating "Return to plan" button with configurable colour.
- FontAwesome icon picker with AJAX search for locked card icons (supports Boost Union extended icon map).
- Custom SCSS injection per template and per competency with client-side validation and server-side compilation.
- Enrolment-aware filtering (all, enrolled, active) for both display modes.
- Single course redirect option when user has only one active enrolment.
- Lock status detection with configurable icons and "Learn More" buttons.
- Availability date display on locked cards.
- Optional "Submit prior learning evidence" button in the Rules tab.
- Moodle Privacy API implementation (`null_provider`).
- Application-level MUC caches for template courses, template SCSS, and competency SCSS.
- Five AJAX web services: course progress, competency courses, user competency summary, FontAwesome icons, and competency rule data.
- Custom capability `local/dimensions:view` for controlling access.
- Event observers for `competency_created` and `competency_updated`.
- Hook callbacks for injecting custom fields into core competency forms and rendering the return button.
- Clean uninstall routine removing all custom fields, file areas, and caches.
- 13 Mustache templates for responsive layouts.
- 4 AMD JavaScript modules: accordion, UI, FontAwesome icon selector, SCSS validation.
- WCAG-compliant accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, screen reader support.
- English and Brazilian Portuguese language packs.
